       <h2 id="part-one">Know Your Attitude</h2>
       <div>
         <p>There are lots of fairy tales and sparkles in romance films and fantasy drama shows. Though the types of relationships we see in movies are not necessarily true in real life, some people continue to live in fantasy land and pattern their relationships after movie situations too much, especially women.</p>

         <p>
           However, some women might not <strong>aware</strong> their attitude and expectations are <strong>unrealistic</strong>. We start off with testing the attitude that shows how much a woman could differentiate between shows and reality.
         </p>
       </div>


       <div class="container-fluid">
       <h4>What's your attitude?</h4>
       1. Do you believe that the types of relationships we see in the movies are possible in real life?
       <form>
           <input type="radio" name="a1" autocomplete="off"> Yes
           <br>
           <input type="radio" name="a1" autocomplete="off"> No
       </form>


       2. You might meet the love of your life in a cafe or store or some other social event by just locking eyes.
       <form>
           <input type="radio" name="a2" autocomplete="off"> Yes
           <br>
           <input type="radio" name="a2" autocomplete="off"> No
       </form>

       3. Like some drama shows, in reality it is possible that true hate will turn into true love in the end.
       <form>
           <input type="radio" name="a3" autocomplete="off"> Yes
           <br>
           <input type="radio" name="a3" autocomplete="off"> No
       </form>
       4. I think suddenly one day a guy will appear in front of me saying he likes me.
       <form>
           <input type="radio" name="a4" autocomplete="off"> Yes
           <br>

                   </div>
               </center>
               <p>As you might noticed, there are differences between romantic films and real life couple situations. It is wise not to use movie themes as an expectation for what a real man would be. Wake up from the fantasy and start getting out to have personal contact with opposite gender. Relationship takes two individuals and it does not happen if you do not <strong>connect through communication</strong>. </p>
